    <li> Animations: Computerized graphics branched off into projects after begining with birthdays, 
    consider them an incentive to keep these moderate-effort-no-cost gifts going all year round.</li>
<hr>
    <li> Art: Better at imitating than creating. So why not go with that and draw simplistic 2-D creatures?
    Tougher to mess up and easier to make them look good too. </li>

    <li> Gamer: Oh all the extended time spent on watching pixels move on a sceen, responding to controls.
    Never regretting that, of course, save for all the rage they may have caused. </li>
